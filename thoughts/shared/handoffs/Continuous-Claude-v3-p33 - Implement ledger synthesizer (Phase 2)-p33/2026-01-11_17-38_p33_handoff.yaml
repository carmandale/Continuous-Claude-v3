  Continue working on Continuous-Claude-v3-p33: Phase 6 (Gas Town Integration)

  Context:
  - Phases 1-5 are COMPLETE
  - Synthesizer exists at `~/.claude/hooks/src/synthesize-ledgers.ts`
  - CLI exists at `~/.claude/scripts/cc-synthesize`
  - SessionStart hook integrates synthesis on startup

  Current state:
  - Core ledger synthesis system is fully operational
  - 46 tests passing across all continuity components
  - Only Gas Town integration (Phase 6) remains

  Next steps:
  1. Find `gt refine` command implementation
  2. Add `cc-synthesize --no-confirm --commit` call
  3. Test the integration
