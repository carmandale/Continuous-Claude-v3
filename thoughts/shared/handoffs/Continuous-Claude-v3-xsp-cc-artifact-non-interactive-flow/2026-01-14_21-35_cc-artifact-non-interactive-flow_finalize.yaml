done_this_session:
  - Added non-interactive mode and enforced required fields for no-edit.
  - Validated bead existence via bd and warned if not in_progress.
  - Normalized outcome values and defaulted to skip editor when fields provided.
final_solutions:
  - Non-interactive cc-artifact usage now avoids editor loops and requires goal/now/outcome.
  - Bead validation prevents accidental handoff creation without a real bead.
final_decisions:
  - Auto-skip editor when required fields are provided and no edit flag set.
  - Fail fast when no-edit/non-interactive lacks required fields.
