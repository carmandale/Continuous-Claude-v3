  Decision: Reasoning
  Repo is source of truth for hooks: Git tracking; sync to global for runtime
  Fail-open on errors: Hooks should never block Claude Code startup

  Continue implementing the Ledger Synthesis System, Phase 1: Event Writer

  Context:
  - Hooks were refactored and hardened (oracle reviewed, 79% line reduction)
  - Plan is at `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-01-11-ledger-synthesis-system.md`
  - Branch: `feat/continuity-system`

  Current state:
  - Hooks are clean and tested (221 lines total)
  - Ready to implement Phase 1: Event Writer

  Next steps:
  1. Read Phase 1 spec from the plan document
  2. Modify `session-end-cleanup.ts` to write event files to `thoughts/shared/handoffs/{workstream}/events/`
  3. Use YAML frontmatter + markdown body format
  4. Test with actual session end
