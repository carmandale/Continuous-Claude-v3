goal: Fix hooks for paths with spaces + Design automatic continuity system
now: Diagnosed hook startup errors - unquoted `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` with spaces; Fixed `.claude/settings.json` - wrapped all paths in quotes; Built hooks (`npm run build` in `.claude/hooks/`); Updated `create_handoff` skill - made Ledger section MANDATORY; Updated `transcript-parser.ts` - auto-handoffs now include Ledger section; Enabled tracking of `thoughts/` directory (was in .gitignore); Consolidated plans to `thoughts/shared/plans/`; Created comprehensive plan for automatic continuity system; Evaluated Continuous Claude compatibility with pi-agent; Documented skill compatibility issues (frontmatter, naming, collisions)
outcome: PARTIAL_MINUS

next:
  - Implement SessionStart hook changes (load on ALL session types)
  - Implement SessionEnd comprehensive hook (checkpoint + learnings)
  - Create background learning extractor
  - Create checkpoints directory structure
  - Test end-to-end continuity flow
  - Fix skill naming (underscores → hyphens) for pi-agent compatibility
blockers:
  - Should checkpoints be in `.checkpoint/` or `thoughts/shared/checkpoints/`?
  - Should we fix skill underscores now or later?
  - Need `sentence-transformers` installed for local embeddings
decisions:
  Decision: Reasoning
  Checkpoint vs Handoff: Checkpoint = auto-save snapshot; Handoff = intentional transfer. Different purposes.
  Background learning extraction: Don't block session end; show results at next session start
  Context >50% triggers checkpoint: Auto-save without prompting; user sees message but isn't blocked
  Ledger section mandatory: Every handoff must have Ledger for continuity to work
  Track thoughts/ in git: Plans and handoffs are valuable artifacts, not ephemeral
learnings:
  worked:
    - Claude Code hooks use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` which fails on paths with spaces (like "Groove Jones")
    - Memory system is agent-agnostic - PostgreSQL backend works for any agent
    - "Skills with `user-invocable: false` are internal rules, not user-facing"
    - Pi-agent reads Claude skills but ignores Claude-specific frontmatter
