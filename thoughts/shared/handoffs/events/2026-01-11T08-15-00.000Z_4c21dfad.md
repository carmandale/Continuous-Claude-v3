goal: Implement Automatic Continuity System to solve "50 First Dates" problem
now: "Created clean PR #32 for hooks path spaces fix (cherry-picked to separate branch); Created feat/continuity-system branch with both fixes + continuity work; Ran pre-mortem on continuity plan - identified 2 tigers, 1 elephant; Installed sentence-transformers dependency; Updated SessionStart hook to fire on ALL session types (removed matcher); Added size/token feedback to SessionStart output; Added previous learnings display to SessionStart; Extended SessionEnd hook with checkpoint creation (>50% context); Created background-learning-extractor.ts for async learning extraction; Created thoughts/shared/checkpoints/ directory; Rebuilt all hooks (project + global)"

  - Verify learnings appear in next session start
decisions:
  Decision: Reasoning
  Merge SessionEnd hooks: "Pre-mortem elephant: two hooks updating ledger would conflict"
  Use os.tmpdir() not /tmp/: "Pre-mortem tiger: macOS uses /var/folders/, not /tmp/"
  Background extraction: User exits immediately, results shown next session
  Checkpoint at 50% context: Balance between capturing state vs noise
